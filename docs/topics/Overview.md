## What is the inspiration behind FoliCon?

I was tired of seeing the same folder icon for all my movies and games folders.
I was in search of an app that can change the folder icon to the poster of the movie or game without my usual steps:

Let's say I have a movie called "The Dark Knight" and I want to change the folder icon to the poster of the movie, my usual steps:
1. Search for the folder icon of movie on Google and deviant-art.
2. Download the icon. which sometimes would be in .ico format and sometimes in .png format.
3. Convert the .png to .ico.
4. Right-click on the folder and click on properties.
5. Click on the customized tab.
6. Click on the change icon button.
7. Browse to the folder where I saved the icon.
8. Select the icon and click on open.
9. Click on apply and then ok. 
10. And finally, I have the folder icon changed.
- OR the desktop.ini method

I wanted to automate this process, A tool existed with a simple motive [Raticon](https://github.com/Jamedjo/Raticon), but it was dead,
and my efforts to try to get it revived didn't work, so I created FoliCon.
