But if you want to use the plain poster without any overlay, you can toggle this option.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="poster-overlay.png" alt="poster overlay" /></td>
        <td><img src="poster-no-overlay.png" alt="poster no overlay" /></td>

    </tr>
</table>

This option is useful when you want to create icons only when the exact match is found 
such in cases where you have a lot of folders to process,
and you don't want to see the poster window for each folder or 
select from ambiguous titles for basically keeping FoliCon on autopilot.
