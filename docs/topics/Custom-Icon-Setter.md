# Custom Icon Setter
<snippet id="custom-icon-setter">

Custom Icon setter is useful when you already have some downloaded icons,
and you want to set them to your matching folders,
without all the hustle of manually setting them up.

You can browse for your parent directory that has all the folders you want to set the icons for,
and then browse for the folder that has all the icons you want to set.

<tip> You can also drag and drop the folders in the respective fields </tip>
<tip> PNG and ICO are supported</tip>

clicking 'Apply' will set the icon for folders that are aligned in the same position.

such as in the below example, the first folder in the parent directory will get the first icon in the icon folder,
the second folder will get the second icon, and so on.
