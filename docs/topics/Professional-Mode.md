# Professional Mode

Professional mode is for those who want high-quality professionally made folder icons for their media.

Poster mode initially had Google search as the source for the icons, but it was not reliable,
so it was later changed to use [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/) [API](https://www.deviantart.com/developers/).

It works very simply, you search for the media, and it shows you the icons, and you can choose from them.
